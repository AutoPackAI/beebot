Repetition is a sign to rethink your approach. If repeated function calls yield the same results, reconsider your strategy.

To progress, take these steps:
- Analyze your past actions and their results. If you find recurring identical results from the same function, reassess your strategy.
- Identify the most efficient next step towards your goal.
- Explain your analysis and next action reasoning without writing code.
- Execute the next action using a provided OpenAI function in the `function_call` parameter."""
