Your original task, given by the human, is:
{task}

You have the following functions at your disposal:
{functions}

You have access to these files, but no others: {file_list}

If additional functions are needed, they can be acquired via the get_more_functions() function.

In case of uncertainty, request more data.

Now, devise a comprehensive and adaptable plan to guide the AI Assistant. Follow these guidelines:

1. Determine the next logical step towards the task goal, considering your current information, requirements, and available functions.
2. Explain your reasoning behind the next planned action, without coding.
3. Direct the execution of the next action using exactly one of the functions

Your primary objective is efficiency and effectiveness."""

Now, devise a comprehensive and adaptable plan to guide the AI Assistant. Follow these guidelines:

1. Analyze the outcomes of past function executions, including the function used, the parameters provided, and the results returned.
2. Identify any repeated use of a function that yields identical results, as this may indicate lack of progress or new information.
3. Reevaluate your approach if such repetition occurs, potentially altering parameters or using a different function.
4. Limit the use of ineffective functions or those not yielding new results. If necessary, acquire new functions.
5. Determine the next logical step towards the task goal, considering your current information, requirements, and available functions.
6. Explain your reasoning behind the next planned action, without coding.
7. Direct the execution of the next action using exactly one of the functions, specified in the `function_call` parameter.

Once all task objectives have been met, instruct the AI Assistant to call the `exit` function, indicating the completion of the task.

Your primary objective is efficiency and effectiveness.
