# BeeBot AI System Architecture

The architecture of BeeBot follows a Stimulus/Action cycle, where a Stimulus represents an event or input that needs to
be processed by the system, and the Action is an action to be taken, typically through a function call. While the
Stimulus is often the direct output of a previous action, it's important to note that the system aims for task
accomplishment rather than complete independence, and it may solicit user feedback to continue. Let's explore the key
components of the architecture:

The Human Body analogy is utilized in BeeBot's architecture to enhance ease of understanding and abstraction. This
choice is made to overcome the ambiguity and multiple meanings associated with commonly used AI terms, allowing for a
clearer representation of the system's components and their interactions.

## Explanation of Components:

1. Sensor: The Sensor component of the system plays a role similar to the parts of the nervous system in the human body
   that deliver stimuli to the Brain. Its function is to receive a Stimulus from the Body and transmit it to the Brain
   for processing and interpretation.

2. Brain: In this architecture, the LLM serves as the Brain. It receives stimuli from the Sensor and generates
   appropriate Actions to be conveyed to the Brainstem. The Brain is responsible for high-level decision-making and
   generating instructions based on the received stimuli. Currently this is one LLM, but in the future we will have
   different LLMs all within the Brain, each excelling at a certain type of task.

3. Brainstem: The Brainstem translates Brain output into an Action that the rest of the body can understand.

4. Executor: The Executor component corresponds to the parts of the nervous system that deliver output from the Brain to
   muscles and other effectors. It receives refined Actions from the Brainstem (via the Body) and executes them in the
   system or environment. The Executor carries out the necessary tasks, computations, or actions based on the received
   instructions, generating Observations that are conveyed back to the system's Body.

5. Body: The Body component encapsulates the entire system, resembling a human body. It integrates sensations, planning,
   and Actions, facilitating the coordination and interaction between different components. Additionally, the Body
   manages memory, allowing for the storage and retrieval of relevant information to support ongoing operations and
   decision-making within the system.

## Explanation of Other Items:

**Stimulus**: A Stimulus refers to an event or input that originates from the system's Body and is transmitted to the
Sensor. It represents the information that needs to be processed and analyzed by the system. The Stimulus serves as a
trigger for the system to generate an appropriate Action or response.

**Action**: An Action represents the system's response to a given Stimulus. It is the outcome of the information
processing performed by the Brain, which determines the appropriate course of action based on the received Stimulus.
Actions may involve executing specific tasks, performing calculations, or making decisions to achieve a desired outcome.
The Executor carries out the Action, and its result is conveyed back to the system's Body.

**Observation**: The Observation, also known as the "Action Output," refers to the result or output of an Action that is
generated by the Executor component and conveyed back to the system's Body. Similar to an observation in the real world,
it provides valuable feedback or information about the effects of the Action. The Observation can influence subsequent
decisions or tasks performed by the Body. While the Observation has the potential to become a Stimulus for the next
cycle, it does not necessarily do so. The Body stores the Observation in memory for reference or further analysis if
needed.

## Basic Flow

The basic cycle of the system is as follows:

1. The Body receives an initial task and proceeds to perform planning and refinements on the task wording.
2. The Sensor converts the task into a Stimulus and transmits it to the Brain for processing.
3. The Brain processes the Stimulus and determines the next action .
4. the Brainstem interprets the response from the Brain and passes it to the Body.
5. The Body sends this next action to the Executor.
6. The Executor executes the action and returns the Observation to the Body.
7. The Body stores the Stimulus-Action-Observation combination in memory for future reference.
8. The Body can either automatically initiate the next action, creating a loop, or wait for user input to start a new
   cycle.

```
[Body] -> [Sensor] -> [Brain] -> [Brainstem] -> [Body] -> [Executor]
  ^                                                            |
  |------------------------------------------------------------|
```

Furthermore, each step of the cycle can store state, enabling persistence and facilitating user feedback or intervention
when necessary.
